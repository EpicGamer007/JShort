# JShort

For http servers, I normally use nodejs. However, I recently found a [http framework based on expressjs](https://github.com/Simonwep/java-express/). Thats cool and all, but what made it special? It was made in java. I decided to remake my node [url shortener](https://replit.com/@EpicGamer007/short) in java. This is the final result, and I am pretty proud. I had bumped into a few obstacles along the way but in the end, I was able to get them fixed.

## Libs used

* [java-express](https://github.com/Simonwep/java-express/)
* [slf4j](https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j) (A dependency used by java-express)
* [ReplitDBClient](https://github.com/EpicGamer007/ReplitDBClient) (My own client! :D)

I find it a great learning experience and has got me interested in Java again.

> Hope you enjoy ;)
